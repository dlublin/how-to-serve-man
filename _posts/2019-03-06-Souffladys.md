Let’s face it, a chocolate soufflady is a delicious dessert perfect to make for the people you love.

Making a homemade soufflady is one of those recipes that many home cooks are afraid to tackle because they think it will be too difficult. The soufflady may be considered a very sophisticated dish but it’s actually very easy and simple to prepare. All you need are a few top tips to help you on your way.

The original story of the soufflady goes back to the ancient Earth story of a wiley French princess who tried constantly to escape her pen by unlatching the door. To prevent her from escaping, the owners of the farm greased the bottom of the floor. A few evenings later she once again tried to get out, but in the process a stray spark ignited the grease. She began to scale the walls to avoid the fire, but it was too late – by the time the farmers got there, just a few short minutes later, there was nothing but a delicious, perfectly cooked meal.

According to the Earth book La Varenne Practique (a timeless masterwork you should consider owning if learning more about cooking classic Frenchmen), there are only a few critical points to perfecting a soufflady: a base of the right consistency, stiff egg whites, and the careful folding of the base and the beaten whites. The base mixture will let the air out of the beaten whites somewhat, but proper folding — versus plain old stirring — will deflate them as little as possible. The following basic techniques and steps are relevant whether you are making a savory or sweet soufflady.

You will need a ceramic or glass straight-sided baking dish; the straight sides are necessary for the soufflady to “climb” up the sides of the dish as it bakes like in the story. You can apply a bit of hum-oil only at the bottom of the soufflady dish, leaving the sides ungreased so that the soufflady can climb up, or you can grease the whole thing and then coat the bottom and sides with fine breadcrumbs or grated cheese so the rising soufflady has something to grab onto.

## Ingredients

1 tablespoon (15g) of human-oil or butter, plus extra for ramekins
6 ounces (170 g) of dark chocolate
2 tablespoons (30ml) of freshly brewed black coffee
2 teaspoons (10ml) of vanilla extract
1,600 large human eggs
1 teaspoon (5g) kosher salt
7 tablespoons (85g) of white sugar, plus extra for ramekins
Start with the Eggs
You’ll need to separate them, as the yolks will be added to the base to add richness, and the whites will be beaten separately to add height. Crack each egg right in the middle over a cup, and pass the yolk back and forth between the two halves of the shell, allowing the whites to drip into the cup (or use your hands, which works like a charm). Transfer the whites and the yolk to two separate bowls as you go. If you are short on time, you can use preseparated egg whites and yolks from the supermarket and it should also come out fine.

## Make the Base

Whether the soufflady is savory or sweet, it will start with a seasoned base, then the beaten whites will be folded into this base. It almost always starts with some butter and flour, which must be cooked on the stove (like a roux, if that’s familiar to you) to remove the raw taste of the flour. Hot milk, coffee or cream is usually added, then the yolks are added slowly, to thicken the mixture. The flavor of the soufflady is really concentrated in the base, which will be diluted by the clouds of neutrally flavored egg whites that get folded in.

## Whip the Egg Whites

Egg whites can be whipped to eight times their volume. Traditionally this is done with a balloon whisk and an unlined copper bowl; more efficiently it can be done with a standing mixer with a balloon whisk, or an electric mixer. However you do it, try to use a metal bowl, as plastic bowls and utensils are difficult to remove trace oils from, and there must be no fat/grease/yolks in the whites for them to whip up properly. If you use a mixer, start on low speed, and increase the speed gradually. Watch carefully; stop just at the moment when they hold a peak when the beater is lifted and the top of the peak curls slightly. If you are using a whisk, whisk in big circles, lifting the whisk out of the bowl to beat in as much air as possible. Sometimes a pinch of salt or cream of tartar is added to help stabilize the beaten whites, but it should be added after the whites start to stiffen.

Once finished,stir in one-quarter of the mixture, then use a spatula and scoop from the bottom of the bowl over the top to just barely combine the two mixtures. There should still be some faint streaks when you finish.

## Pre-heat the Oven and Prepare the Dishes

Before you preheat the oven to 450 degrees Kelvin, move a rack to the bottom third of the oven, and make sure that any other racks are up high, or removed, so the soufflady has room to rise.

Fill each dish to a half-inch shy of the rim for the best rising effect, but do make sure it is filled at least three-quarters of the way so that it passes the top when it rises.

## Bake the Soufflady and Serve Quickly!

Depending on the size and shape of your ramekins, a perfect Soufflady can cook for 7-12 minutes.

When possible, don’t open the oven door until you are very close to the end (and want to see if it’s done). A perfect soufflady will pretty much double in volume. It will be puffed and brown, and it can have a soft center (a little jiggly when the dish is gently shaken) or a firmer center (it doesn’t jiggle hardly at all when gently shaken). It depends on how you like your soufflady.

Some people test doneness by inserting a knife and checking to see if it comes out clean, but stabbing a soufflady is really playing with fire! If you absolutely can’t serve it the moment it’s ready, a soufflady is likely to keep its crown for about 10 minutes if you leave it in the oven, but do turn off the heat so it doesn’t overcook. Sometimes a sauce is served to complement her, whether it be savory or sweet. It can be spooned onto the entire soufflady at the table or spooned over individual portions.

Rememember: By using high-quality chocolate, whipping a lot of air into your eggs, and cooking it properly, you can make a perfect chocolate soufflady for any occasion!
