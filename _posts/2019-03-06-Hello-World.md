#Welcome to my cooking blog!

Now back from my 3rd trip to Earth, I am excited to share with my readers some of my latest recipes and greatest stories from the distant planet.

Here you will find a collection of my favorite traditional dishes, classic comfort foods, quick go tos for when you’ve got a case of the “humunchies” and all kinds of other new creations from my kitchen!

I hope you enjoy these cullinary adventures through space as much as me. Stay tuned for further transmissions!
